# Astronomy Image Archive
Database management, header parser and frontend for FTS files used by astronomical telescope.

This project was created for the NASA Universe of Learning GTN website, and is connected to Sonoma State University's GORT telescope. Application works with a MongoDB instance, a folde containing .fts images from a telescope, and a React frontend. A number of design elements are specific to its current deployment at the moment, but could be modified to work for others. Backend is running with Node.js.
